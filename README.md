### BATTLETANKS

Online version: https://react-battletanks.herokuapp.com

This is my first React project for creating a portfolio.
You can try it online (see above link), or you can clone this repo and modify it as you want.

To deploy it locally, just run 'npm install' inside the root folder to install all nodejs dependencies.
After installation is done, run 'npm start', this should open the browser with the main page.

Any suggestion about how to improve performance or game logic will be appreciated!!!

### Known issues

- Need to refactor the css styles to make it work on mobiles

Enjoy!
